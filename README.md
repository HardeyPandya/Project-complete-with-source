# Project-complete-with-source
I made a simple educational project to understand basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning as a final year project for completion of my Diploma Engineering.
Implemented some popular machine learning models used to predict Stock Price like :
SVR (using scikit sklearn library),
LSTM (used Keras on the top of TensorFlow), and
hybrid CNN and RNN model (used Keras on the top of TensorFlow).
Also performed simple Sentimental Analysis from business news articles available at moneycontrol.com using bag-of-words model. (Used PyCharm IDE with Python Programming Language)


Currently only source code is given. I also have tkinter-made GUI which can be standalone executed on windows platform, which will be uploaded soon. However, output screenshot can be seen through .pdf file.
